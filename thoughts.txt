Problem description
- Input
    - Text either by file or command line
    - One result game per line
    - Expect input to be well-formed
    - Follows format
        - (Team name) (Num goals), (Team name) (Num goals)
- Output
    - Output should be ordered in descending order
    - If same rank the teams tied should be ordered in alphabetical order
    - Follow format 
        - #Rank. Team Name, # pt(s)
- Rules
    - Draw is 1 point
    - Victory is 3 points
    - Loss is 0 points
    - Same points = Same rank

Problem assumptions (Possible tests)
- Assumptions
    - No malformed input
        - Bad syntax *
    - Logically incorrect input 
        - Negative results
        - Not integer results
        - Names with no commas in it
        - Goals within INT possible values
        - Same team names in a match result
    - Input assumptions
        - Input may have capitalization wrong and solution shouldn’t be case sensitive
        - Spaces may vary and be multiples where one or none is expected
    - Output assumptions
        - If 2 or more teams have same rank, it will replace the following ranks depending on how many teams have the same ranks
            - I.e. Two rank 3 teams means there is no rank 4, we jump from 3 to 5
            - I.e. Four rank 3 teams means there is no rank 4,5,6, and we jump from 3 to 7
        - Points should be represented by the “# pts” string, except for cases where a team has 1 pt in which case it should be “# pt”.
        - Since this solution assumes input should be case sensitive the output names will be formatted lower case.
