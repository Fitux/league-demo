# league-demo

This code was developed using Visual Studio Code, so if you open the project using VS Code it should be a matter of just running the program and I will automatically use the example.txt file as an input for the program.

In case that you want to run this program manually, it just a matter of running the App.java in any console and sending the file path of the input as the first argument of execution. There is an example file that can be used.

For example

java -cp path/to/compiled/code/classes com.league.App /Users/fitux/Dev/league-demo/league-demo/example.txt 

PS: Remember to compile the code first by using javac
